# University of Helsinki - Full Stack Open 2024

## Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.

This year's edition of the course contains a new part on TypeScript. Content for this part is provided by Terveystalo

The course is worth 3-9 credits, and the content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2020. There is also an associated project that is worth 1-10 credits.

Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, and to know the basics of working with the Git version-control system. You are also expected to have perseverance and the ability for independent problem solving and information seeking.
